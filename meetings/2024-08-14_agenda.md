# OpenADE Task Force Meeting 2024-08-14

## Agenda
* Welcome
* Introductions of attendees
* Review and approve minutes


* Code Snippets
    * How to link Customer ServiceLocation meters to their UsagePoints (**pending**)
    * How to report billing dollar amounts in the UsageSummary costAdditionalDetailLastPeriod LineItem structure 
      (pending)
    * Best Practice settings for access_token and refresh_token expiration (**pending**)


* CMD Certification Platform Completed Updates
    * All GET Resource URI TestSteps are being refactored to support "200 OK", "202 Accepted", "400 Bad Request", 
      and "403 Forbidden" 
      status code responses
        * "200 OK" status code responses are used for synchronous operations
        * "202 Accepted" status code responses are used for asynchronous operations
            * The CMD Certification Platform will wait for the Third Party Notification Endpoint to receive a BatchList 
              message and then complete the GET Resource URI TestStep using the contents of the "resource" element
        * "400 Bad Request" status code responses are used for invalid requests
            * The CMD Certification Platform will verify the response contains "An unprocessed batch request for the 
              same resource already exists" and treat the status code as a "202 Accepted" response.
        * "403 Forbidden" status code responses are used for unauthorized requests
            * The CMD Certification Platform will perform an OAuth 2.0 "Refresh Token" flow and then retry the request. 
        * All SoapUI Templated GET Resource URI requests have been refactored to use the same SoapUI TestCase in the 
          Library TestSuite 
  * All GET Authorization URI TestSteps are being refactored to support "200 OK", "202 Accepted", "400 Bad Request",
    and "403 Forbidden"
    status code responses
      * "200 OK" status code responses are used for synchronous operations
      * "202 Accepted" status code responses are used for asynchronous operations
          * The CMD Certification Platform will wait for the Third Party Notification Endpoint to receive a BatchList
            message and then complete the GET Resource URI TestStep using the contents of the "resource" element
      * "400 Bad Request" status code responses are used for invalid requests
          * The CMD Certification Platform will verify the response contains "An unprocessed batch request for the
            same resource already exists" and treat the status code as a "202 Accepted" response.
      * "403 Forbidden" status code responses are used for unauthorized requests
          * The CMD Certification Platform will perform an OAuth 2.0 "Client Credential" flow and then retry the 
            request.
      * All SoapUI Templated GET Resource URI requests have been refactored to use the same SoapUI TestCase in the
        Library TestSuite
  *  [FB_31] Energy Usage Authorization and Authentication w/o Pre-Negotiated Scope TestSuite OAD013 [NEG]
     [old A] Valid refresh_token request invalidates prior access_token TestCase has been deleted
      * The purpose of the OAD013 TestCase was to verify that after an OAuth 2.0 "Refresh Token" flow that any 
        existing access token was no longer valid
      * The "OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework" [RFC 6749] allows multiple access tokens to be valid, and although 
        it requires any existing refresh_token to be invalid after the "Refresh Token" flow it allows any existing 
        access token to be valid until it expires
      * Since the OAuth 2.0 standard does not require existing access tokens to expire when a "Refresh Token" flow 
        is performed, the OAD013 TestCase is not valid and has been removed~
  *  [FB_65] Energy Usage Authorization and Authentication w/o Pre-Negotiated Scope TestSuite OAD033 [NEG]
     [old A] Valid refresh_token request invalidates prior access_token TestCase has been deleted
      * The purpose of the OAD013 TestCase was to verify that after an OAuth 2.0 "Refresh Token" flow that any
        existing access token was no longer valid
      * The "OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework" [RFC 6749] allows multiple access tokens to be valid, and although
        it requires any existing refresh_token to be invalid after the "Refresh Token" flow it allows any existing
        access token to be valid until it expires
      * Since the OAuth 2.0 standard does not require existing access tokens to expire when a "Refresh Token" flow 
      * is performed, the OAD013 TestCase is not valid and has been removed (**COMPLETED**)~ 


* CMD Certification Platform Pending Updates 
  * Add a new optional Function Block to verify the utility is properly reporting digital billing dollar amounts 
    in the UsageSummary costAdditionalDetailLastPeriod LineItem structure
      * What should the Energy Usage Function Block be named? 
      * Should the new Function Block be added to the Version 3.3 and the Version 4.0 TestSuites?
  * Add a new optional Function Block to verify the utility is properly reporting retrievable digital billing 
    statements
      * What should the Retail Customer Function Block be named?
      * Should the new Function Block be added to the Version 3.3 and the Version 4.0 TestSuites?
          * If added to the Version 3.3 TestSuites should the CMD Certification Platform be renamed to not follow 
            the NAESB naming convention?
              * Since the NAESB ESPI version 4.0 standard requires only TLS 1.3, utilities with cloud frontends that 
                support TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 fail the [FB_13] Energy Usage Security and Privacy and [FB_64] 
                Retail Customer Security and Privacy Test that want to support Digital Statements
  * Add a new TestStep to [FB_58] Retail Customer ServiceLocation Information to confirm the utility is properly 
    referencing UsagePoints located at the customer's ServiceLocation
  * Should [FB_36] Third Party Dynamic Registration be made a mandatory Function Block
      * [FB_36] was defined for the original CMD Certification Platform as an optional Function Block
      * Making it a mandatory Function Block will require all utilities to support the "OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client 
        Registration Protocol" [RFC 7591] and the "OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Management Protocol" [RFC 7592]
        to be certified
